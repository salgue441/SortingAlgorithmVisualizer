# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This is a simple visualizer for sorting algorithms. It is written in C++ using the SDL2 library.

## Functionality

The visualizer shows how the different sorting algorithms tackle each sort. The app shows with 
white bars the different elements of a randomly generated integer vector, the red bar shows the 
element being sorted, and the blue bar shows how the sorting algorithm is sorting the elements.
